# Recent Module Enhancements

This document describes the recent improvements made to the Cloudflare account rulesets modules.

## Complete Restructuring to Modular Approach (March 2025)

The module has been restructured to provide a fully modular approach with minimal setup required for users. Key changes:

1. **New Deployments Module**
   - Created a dedicated module for managing root ruleset deployments
   - Moved root ruleset detection and deployment from root directory to the module
   - Added comprehensive import instructions and safety features

2. **Improved Module Integration**
   - Modules now pass information to each other through outputs
   - Root module provides a simplified interface for all submodules
   - Each submodule can be used independently if needed

3. **Enhanced Documentation**
   - Added README for each module with usage examples
   - Updated main README with the new module structure
   - Created clear examples for both simple and advanced usage patterns

4. **Code Organization**
   - Moved data sources for managed rulesets to the managed_rules module
   - Integrated root ruleset detection into the deployments module
   - Used existing module outputs to manage deployments

5. **Simplified User Experience**
   - Users can now use a single module reference with variable configurations
   - Alternatively, users can use individual modules for more control
   - Import instructions are automatically generated based on detected resources

## Automatic Ruleset Creation & Management (Previous Update)

The module has been completely redesigned to safely manage Cloudflare rulesets with multiple safeguards:

1. **Complete Root Ruleset Lifecycle Management**:
   - Implemented proper handling of Cloudflare's one-root-ruleset-per-phase limit
   - Added automatic creation of root rulesets when they don't exist
   - Added dynamic discovery of existing root rulesets
   - Used ID-based referencing to modify existing root rulesets
   - Added `lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true }` to protect critical resources
   - Made root ruleset management explicit with `var.manage_root_rulesets` toggle

2. **Fixed Resource Management**:
   - Removed duplicate resource declarations
   - Implemented proper rule merging that preserves existing rules
   - Added data-driven approach for dynamic ruleset discovery
   - Fixed output references to properly reflect resource state

3. **Enhanced Safety Features**:
   - Added detailed import instructions with pre-generated commands
   - Provided comprehensive output with deployment status
   - Created conditional resource creation based on existing infrastructure
   - Added safety checks to prevent accidental destruction
   - Implemented proper documentation with warning messages
   
4. **Production Ready Updates**:
   - Created usable deployment resources for all phases
   - Added proper error handling for all edge cases
   - Ensured backward compatibility with existing rulesets
   - Created comprehensive documentation and examples

## Cloudflare API Compatibility Fixes (Previous Update)

Based on Cloudflare API requirements, the following fixes were implemented:

1. **Removed logging settings for non-skip actions**:
   - Cloudflare only allows logging options when using the 'skip' action
   - Updated all modules to remove logging settings for other actions like block, js_challenge, etc.

2. **Root Ruleset Limitations**:
   - Addressed the limitation that Cloudflare allows only one root ruleset per phase
   - Modified modules to work with existing root rulesets instead of creating new ones
   - Enhanced modules to discover existing root rulesets via data sources
   - Provided rule templates that can be added to existing root rulesets
   - Added instructions for importing existing root rulesets into Terraform state

## 1. Improved Error Handling

The managed_rules module now has improved error handling with fallback IDs:

- Added `fallback_owasp_ruleset_id` and `fallback_cloudflare_ruleset_id` variables
- The module will gracefully handle cases where ruleset discovery fails
- Added outputs to indicate whether discovery was successful

## 2. Enhanced Data Source Module

The data_source module now provides better filtering capabilities:

- Client-side filtering for more precise ruleset selection
- Added support for regex pattern matching in name filters
- Exposed filtered results as a separate output
- Added specific outputs for OWASP and Cloudflare managed rulesets

## 3. Integration Between Modules

The managed_rules module now leverages the data_source module for ruleset discovery:

- Replaced direct data source usage with the reusable data_source module
- Added filter capabilities to narrow down ruleset searches
- Improved modularity and separation of concerns

## 4. Consistent Configuration Pattern

All modules now follow a consistent configuration pattern:

- Standard variable definitions across modules
- Consistent error handling approach
- Well-documented outputs with descriptions
- Proper use of optional parameters and default values

## 5. Usage With Fallback Values

Example usage with fallback values for managed rules:

```hcl
module "account_rulesets_with_fallbacks" {
  source = "./account_rulesets"
  
  cloudflare_account_id  = var.cloudflare_account_id
  account_owasp_pub_key  = var.account_owasp_pub_key
  account_managed_pub_key = var.account_managed_pub_key
  
  # Fallback IDs in case dynamic discovery fails
  fallback_owasp_ruleset_id = "4814384a9e5d4991b9815dcfc25d2f1f"
  fallback_cloudflare_ruleset_id = "efb7b8c7ab8c4d6fb56739341a7e824e"
}
```

## 6. Data Flow Improvements

The updated module data flow is as follows:

```
Main Module
   │
   ├─► Custom Rules Module ──► Create custom rulesets
   │
   ├─► Rate Limiting Module ──► Create rate limiting rulesets
   │
   ├─► Managed Rules Module
   │     │
   │     └─► Data Source Module ──► Discover ruleset IDs
   │            │
   │            └─► Apply filters ──► Return ruleset data
   │
   └─► Data Source Module (optional standalone) ──► Ruleset information
```

## 7. Module Update Summary

| Module | Updates |
|--------|---------|
| **managed_rules** | - Now uses data_source module<br>- Added fallback ID support<br>- Improved error handling |
| **data_source** | - Added client-side filtering<br>- Added specialized ruleset outputs<br>- Better error handling with try() |
| **custom_rules** | - No changes in this update |
| **rate_limiting** | - No changes in this update |

## 8. Testing the Changes

After updating the modules, test with the following steps:

1. Run a plan to verify the changes:
   ```bash
   tofu plan -var-file=secrets.tfvars
   ```

2. Apply the changes:
   ```bash
   tofu apply -var-file=secrets.tfvars
   ```

3. Verify that ruleset discovery is working by checking outputs:
   ```bash
   tofu output -json | jq '.managed_rules_module.outputs'
   ```

## 9. Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements include:

1. Adding dynamic discovery support to custom_rules and rate_limiting modules
2. Improving error handling with detailed error messages
3. Adding support for more complex filtering patterns
4. Implementing automatic recovery strategies for ruleset discovery failures
